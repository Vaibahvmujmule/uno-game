# UNO Game

This repository contains a multiplayer UNO game (frontend + backend). This initial commit provides a minimal scaffold so the repository is no longer empty.

   git clone https://github.com/Vaibahvmujmule/uno-game.git
2. Install dependencies for server:
   cd uno-game/server
   npm install
3. Start the server:

The repository will be expanded with the client app and full game logic in subsequent commits.
